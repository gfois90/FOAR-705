#Digital humanities proof of concept: Understanding Online Chat with Sentiment Analysis 

##Background

This project was put together as part of the FOAR705 -- Digital Humanities -- masters level course at Macquarie University (Sydney, Australia). It is a proof of concept, attempting to use a combination of machine and lexicon based approaches to sentiment analysis to extract data from the live chat of a Twitch broadcast. 

The following was written in R

I have included code to conduct a lexicon analysis on the example text. (You must use your own destinations and filenames)

I have included code to train a machine learning classifier (You must use your own destinations and filenames)

The following was writting in Processing and WordCram

I have included code to generate a Ying-Yang wordcloud in WordCram. (You must use your own destinations and filenames)

The following was written in Visual Studio

I have included a basic IRC to connect to Twitch IRC. It relays chat but lacks logging functionality.
